# System Programming and Compiler Construction (SPCC)

Welcome to the System Programming and Compiler Construction (SPCC) repository! This repository is designed for students learning SPCC under the Mumbai University syllabus. It contains practical programs and assignments with detailed explanations to help students understand the concepts of system-level programming and compiler design.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

About the Repository

This repository includes:

1.Programs and examples for system programming (assemblers, loaders, linkers, etc.).
2.Compiler design programs (lexical analyzer, parsers, intermediate code generation, etc.).
3.Conceptual explanations and sample inputs/outputs.
4.Aligned with the Mumbai University syllabus for the SPCC course.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The repository is maintained by Pratik Zinjad, Teaching Assistant at Saraswati College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai, to assist students in mastering system programming and compiler construction.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Requirements

To run the programs in this repository, you need:

1.A C compiler (e.g., GCC or Turbo C).
2.Flex (Fast Lexical Analyzer Generator) for lexical analysis programs.
3.Yacc or Bison for parser-related programs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Syllabus Description

This repository contains a collection of experiments designed to provide hands-on experience with key concepts in compiler design, programming languages, and software development. The following experiments are intended to give students and practitioners the practical knowledge required for building different components of a compiler or similar systems.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

List of Experiments

-1.Implementation of Two-Pass Assembler

Objective: Implement a two-pass assembler to translate assembly language code into machine code. The first pass generates symbol tables, while the second pass handles code generation and linking.
Key Concepts: Assembler design, symbol table management, machine code generation.


-2.Implementation of Two-Pass Macro Processor

Objective: Build a macro processor that operates in two passes to handle macros and expand them into corresponding assembly code.
Key Concepts: Macros, text substitution, macro expansion, preprocessing.


-3.Implementation of Lexical Analyzer

Objective: Develop a lexical analyzer that breaks down a stream of source code into tokens, recognizing keywords, identifiers, operators, and literals.
Key Concepts: Regular expressions, finite automata, tokenization, lexical analysis.


-4.Implementation of Parser (Any One)

Objective: Implement a parser using either top-down (e.g., recursive descent) or bottom-up (e.g., LR parser) parsing techniques to construct a parse tree from a source code.
Key Concepts: Context-free grammars, parsing techniques, syntax analysis, parse trees.


-5.Implementation of Intermediate Code Generation Phase of Compiler

Objective: Implement the intermediate code generation phase of a compiler to translate source code into an intermediate representation that is easier to optimize and translate to machine code.
Key Concepts: Intermediate representation, control flow graphs, syntax-directed translation.


-6.Implementation of Code Generation Phase of Compiler

Objective: Implement the code generation phase to translate intermediate code into target machine code or assembly.
Key Concepts: Code generation, instruction selection, register allocation.


-7.Study and Implementation of Experiments on LEX, YACC

Objective: Learn and implement experiments using LEX for lexical analysis and YACC for parser generation, automating the process of building language parsers and analyzers.
Key Concepts: LEX, YACC, syntax trees, grammar definitions, language processing.
